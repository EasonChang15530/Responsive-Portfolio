      <p>I'm Bailing, living in the University City of Philly now. I just moved here 2 months ago from Beijing, China. I have about 5 years of working experience, as a senior product manager, focusing on front-end and back-end industrial and financial products. I have a little Python language foundation, and I did python programming work for the UAV image automatic index during my masterâ€™s period.</p>
      <p>By the way, Chinese language and Chinese history, which are what I am good at. I have won several champions in various competitions about them. So, if anybody would have any interest in Chinese, please feel free to talk to me.</p>
