      <p>Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Bailing, living in the University City of Philly now. I come from Beijing, China. I have about 5 years of working experience. I like traveling everywhere, and my wish is to go far away and meet different people. I like reading in my leisure time, especially like history and culture, and I have great enthusiasm for new things. </p>
      <p>By the way, Chinese language and Chinese history, which are what I am good at. I have won several champions in various competitions about them. So, if anybody would have any interest in Chinese, please feel free to talk to me.</p>
